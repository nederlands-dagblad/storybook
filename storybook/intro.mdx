# 🎨 Welcome to the Nederlands Dagblad Design System

AKA: The sacred scrolls of pixels, paddings, and the divine color palette.

## ✨ What is this?

This is your one-stop shop for building beautiful, consistent interfaces without having to reinvent the button every single time.

Think of it as a style guide, a component library, and a digital therapist for developers and designers who just want things to look right without arguing about the difference between #fdfdfd and #ffffff.

## 🎯 Why does this exist?

Because chaos is fun… until your UI looks like a ransom note.

The design system keeps things:
- 🧼 Clean – Everything aligns. Everything matches. Your designer will finally stop crying.
- 🔁 Reusable – Stop building the same modal for the 47th time.
- 🧭 Predictable – Components behave the way you expect. Surprises are for birthdays, not buttons.

## 🧩 What’s inside?

- Tokens – Colors, spacing, typography, and all those values you hardcoded at 3AM but shouldn’t have.
- Components – Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, separated in atoms, molecules, organisms, and all that jazz.
- Patterns – How to build pages quickly with React, hooks and other tools.

## 🛠️ How to use it?

- **Read it.** Yes, reading is involved. We’re sorry.
- **Use the components.** Copy, import, whatever floats your boat.
- **Stick to the rules.** They exist for a reason (and that reason is not "to ruin your creative flow").
- **Contribute (carefully).** Want to add or change something? Let’s chat. Preferably before your pull request starts a small war.

## 👋 Final words

Treat this design system like a plant: use it, water it with feedback, and don’t leave it to die in a dusty Notion doc.
